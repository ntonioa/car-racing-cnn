\section{Conclusions}
Let us sum up the main results of this report. Two different CNNs (with different structures and hyperparameters) have been built and used to solve the image classification problem that was proposed. The dataset has been preprocessed in order to delete unnecessary and/or misleading information. With the objective of improving performance, adjustments have been made, precautions have been taken and experiments have been carried out. The threat of overfitting has been kept away with regularization strategies and early stopping.
Moreover, the analysis of the performance in realtion to the class weights has shown that the choice of the weights is crucial for the success of the models.

\noindent \\Despite these efforts, though, the final results are not outstanding: the main problem could be that the dataset is not sufficient to train a CNN that can generalize well, especially on the given validation set, which is quite different from the training set. Supporting this there is the fact that the models score quite similarly to each other in the tests that have been conducted, so the problem would not seem to reside in the network tuning phase.
