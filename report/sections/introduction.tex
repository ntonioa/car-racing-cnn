\section{Introduction}
The goal of this homework is to put into practice the concepts acquired on convolutional neural networks during the lectures by solving an image classification problem with the ultimate (optional) goal of learning a function that is capable of driving a race car in the \href{https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/car_racing/}{"Car Racing" Gym environment}.
\\The dataset (provided already split into training and validation sets) contains color images of size $96 \times 96$, each labeled with one of five actions available for race car control.

\noindent \\It is required to define two different approaches, train them with different hyperparameters, compare them, and visualize and discuss the results.
For this specific report, the Python language (and the Keras library) is used via the Jupyter application.
